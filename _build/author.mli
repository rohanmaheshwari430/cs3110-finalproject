   Academic Integrity Statement

   We, the people named in the @author comment above, have fully reviewed the
   course academic integrity policies. We have adhered to those policies in
   solving the assignment.

   The policies do permit some limited collaboration among students currently
   enrolled in the course. If we did engage in such collaboration, here is the
   list of other students with whom we collaborated, and a brief summary of that
   collaboration:

   - none

   Here are any deviations from the policies that we want to document, with the
   understanding that being honest about my mistakes is more honorable than
   lying about our intellectual work:

   - none
